# Project-task-recorder

    A simple web app to be used by mobile devices in order to easilly keep accurate track of what tasks a subcontract residential remodeling worker performs, document the start,  each primary/ important step/ and the end result by taking photos between 1 and 5 for each task/step, select which task performing via project list or generate dynamically 

     DashBoard / Main Section 

 Select between creating a new task list dynamically using one of the standard schemas/templates on the fly, or use a premade project task list you made ahead of time to keep track of each primary component and or phase of a larger project, or, one provided by a client/ contractor to help you and them stay on the same page, document all the important steps/ phases of a project for later verification / billing / proof of completion etc.

  either way the main steps are largely the same.   once you have your first task ready to start, youll begain by providing the site/project name, id, address, and date/time. *Most if not all of this can/ will be automatically generated and entered for you if to allow your device permissions to the app.  first thing first,  you'll almost always start by snapping a few photographs with your devices camera.   generally this is done to provide clear pre start information and a picture is worth a thousand words.   you will be given the chance to edit / crop / rotate etc. each captured image as they are taken, or, you can return to them at any time in the future.   

  while capturing the photos,  you have the option to provide either a verbal audio recording for notation, transcribe audio to text for easy text generated notes about each photo/ step.  or manually type in a note for each photo that you wish to provide one for. 

  you can capture up to 10 photographs for each unique task step/phase/or other dicumentational event/reason you find important while completing the task. 

  all of the original captured photographs are automatically dated, gps coordinate assigmed, and stored for later viewing/editing/ sharing inside the current task project directory on your mobile device as well as a backup copy created several times a day after changes/additional updates are detected from the last update. 

  a set of thimbail images one of each captured photograph will be displayed when you expand the details panel of avparticular step/phase of a task.  while expanded a neatly formatted dynamically generate table will show each photo taken, the meta data such as created on date/time, at gps location, by <user/device>, each will be assigned a numeric id # unique in the project and used to simply keep track of the image and link it to the related note/information etc.  the user may choose to remove a particular photo from the project, duplicates or bad shots etc can be removed at any time.   the photo will be instantly removed from your app but a backup copy will remain for a limited amount of time on the server just in case you accidently remove one you need and can't easily take another photo of,  you can review all recently remived photos from your project within 72 hrs or so, unless soecific limits otherwise prihibit, but you can go to your recently removed bin , located on your main page/ dash board,  open it and you'll see anotger neatly formatted dynamically generate table with a clickable thumbnail of each recently removed image and the day/ time/project/task/step or phae,v first bit of text from notes etc, and or a clickable link to the audio note create/ removed with it when thumbnail or audio link is clicked the full image and or full audio file will be provided for viewing/playing via a new popup dialog window,  the user may restore and recently removed item still available in this directory.  once it has expired, or the project itself is closed/completed from administrative side, no edits/ changes are any longer possible,  so this ans done other conditions otger then tine expiration may limit retrieval.
